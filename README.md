# Egg Incubator Project

A Raspberry Pi, Node Red chick incubator to hatch chicken eggs.

Hobby project are great but it is time to put the Raspberry Pi to work feeding your family and making money.  More peole than ever are wainting to eat their own eggs and chicken rather than factory farmed strangelings ther were fed questionable substances.

## Cabinet Construction
This cabinet holds 400+ eggs.  Puting in a new tray every 5 days, you can hatch out around 600 chicks per month with this unit.  25 laying hens can produce this amount of eggs.

## Electronics Assembly
How I put the Pi together with relays and other parts to monitor and control the incubator.

## Node Red Programming
Simple Node Red programming.  You can do this project using only a heat controller but with the Pi and Node Red, you can do scheduluing, graphing, network video monitoring, motion-detect hatch alerts, data logging etc.
